Off-site movement of waste is not currently envisaged;(d) In the event of unplanned discharges of radioactive waste, which may follow an accident on the scale considered in the General Data, the doses likely to be received by the population in other Member States would not be significant from the point of view of health.In conclusion, the Commission is of the opinion that the implementation of the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste, resulting from the commissioning of the liquid metal disposal plant (LMDP) and the waste receipt, assay, characterisation and supercompaction facility (WRACS), both in normal operation and in the event of an accident of the type and magnitude considered in the General Data, is not liable to result in the radioactive contamination, significant from the point of view of health, of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State. \n",
