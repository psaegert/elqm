Member States and the Community should formulate indicative targets as a guideline for this share in the medium (2010) to long term (2020) to strive for and to measure progress in this field. The indicative target to double the overall share of renewables in the Community by 2010 as mentioned in the Green Paper is ambitious and could give useful guidance for increased efforts at Community as well as at Member State level.</p><p>(3) NOTES that within the framework of liberalization of energy markets an active governmental policy at the level of Member States and - taking into account the principle of subsidiarity - at Community level is necessary to improve the competitiveness of renewables.</p><p>(4) CONSIDERS that essential elements with an important Community dimension to be applied in a pragmatic manner according to the level of technological progress are in the following fields:</p><p>- research, technological development and demonstration (paragraph 5),</p><p>- market conditions (paragraph 6 to 8),</p><p>- actions to promote consumer information and confidence (paragraph 6 and 9),</p><p>- coordination and monitoring (paragraph 10).</p><p>(5) BELIEVES that in the field of research, technological development and demonstration a strong commitment and continuation of the fourth framework programme and an adequate provision for the support for renewables in the fifth framework programme are required.</p><p>UNDERLINES the importance of national efforts in the field of research, development and demonstration in respect of the implementation of renewable energy sources in the Member States.</p><p>(6) CONFIRMS that the harmonization of standards on renewables in the Community would serve the double purpose of facilitating introduction of new technologies into the internal market and boosting confidence in these technologies.</p><p>INVITES the appropriate standardization bodies in the Community to continue their work in this field.</p><p>(7) BELIEVES that in order to stimulate the market for renewables, appropriate regulatory measures encouraging market participants to buy energy produced from renewable resources may be introduced.</p><p>(8) RECALLS that, according to Community Guidelines on State Aid for Environmental Protection (7) and in view of the especially high priority in the Community given to the development of renewables, investment aid for renewables can, in appropriate cases, also be authorized when they exceed the general levels of aid contained in these Guidelines, and that the beneficial effects of such measures to the environment must outweigh the distortive effects on competition.</p><p>(9) BELIEVES that the dissemination of information will increase market confidence and awareness in renewables, and allow customers to make informed choices.</p><p>Actions to increase customer choice for renewable energy can prove important for the development of sustainable energy. As a suggestion for action in this field, energy distributors could, by means of special tariffs, grant the possibility to customers to buy electricity produced from renewables.</p><p>(10) CONSIDERS that to make optimal use of available resources good coordination and monitoring of progress are required and that coordination should be strengthened within the Commission services and between Member States. To formulate a comprehensive and mutually reinforcing strategy, different policies and programmes in various fields must be taken into account.</p><p>(11) WELCOMES the presentation by the Commission of the Green Paper and INVITES the Commission to develop a comprehensive strategy for the promotion of renewable sources of energy on the basis of the principles outlined above.</p><p></p><p>(1) OJ No C 224, 1. 8. 1996, p. 1.</p><p>(2) OJ No L 126, 18. 5. 1994, p. 1.

Whereas this aid is paid not to the coalfields but only to the central administration of Charbonnages de France; </p><p> Whereas the abovementioned aids meet the criteria laid down in the Decision for the admissibility of such state assistance; </p><p> Whereas the aid of FF 2 655 800 000 proposed by the French Government for 1980 to cover losses (of which FF 2 305 800 000, is to cover the coalfields&#039;losses on mining and FF 350 000 000 to cover the losses sustained by the central administration of Charbonnages de France) will not be higher than the likely operating losses of Charbonnages de France; </p><p> Whereas the following points are relevant in connection with aid to the individual coalfields:    1. In 1980, aid to the Nord/Pas-de-Calais and Centre-Midi coalfields will be calculated in such a way that, as a result of the closure of further pits, there will be a reduction in production, which will mean that some 2 150 fewer persons will be employed in the coal industry. The aids will prevent severe economic and social disruption in areas where there are not yet adequate opportunities for reemployment. The aids to these coalfields therefore comply with the provisions of the first subparagraph of Article 12 (1) and Article 12 (2) of the Decision. </p><p>      2. The output planning of the Charbonnages de France in the Lorraine coalfields aims at long-term stabilization, since the coking coal produced in this coalfield is important for supplying the steel industry. The aid granted for this purpose complies with the second subparagraph of Article 12 (1) and Article 12 (3) of the Decision. </p><p>      </p><p> </p><p> II </p><p> Whereas, under Article 3 (2) of the Decision, an examination of the compatibility of the proposed aids with the proper functioning of the common market must also extend to all other financial measures to support current production in 1980; </p><p> Whereas the sum of all these aids to support current production by the French coal industry is 461 400 000 ECU, or 25 764 ECU per tonne, for 1980 ; whereas this is higher than corresponding German and United Kingdom aids but lower than Belgian aid; </p><p> Whereas the following points must be made about the compatibility of the proposed aid with the proper functioning of the common market:    - there were no supply difficulties on the French coal market in 1980, </p><p>      - French coal exports to other Community countries fell in 1980 compared with 1979,  (1) OJ No L 63, 11.3.1976, p. 1.  </p><p>      - hardly any price alignment agreements were entered into for French coal in 1980, </p><p>      - industrial consumers of coal did not directly receive aid in 1980 through the prices of French coking coal and steam coal, </p><p>      - the closure of three marginal pits in the Nord/Pas-de-Calais and Centre-Midi coalfield resulted in rationalization and concentration of production on pits where productivity is highest; </p><p>      </p><p> </p><p> Whereas it may accordingly be concluded that the aids proposed in 1980 for current production by the French coal industry are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market; </p><p> Whereas this applies even when account is taken of aids to coal mines under Decision 73/287/ECSC; </p><p> III </p><p> Whereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must satisfy itself that the approved aids are used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 of that Decision ; whereas consequently the Commission is to be notified in particular of the amount of the aid and the manner in which it is apportioned, </p><p> HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p><p> </p><p>   Article 1</p><p> The French Republic is hereby authorized to grant to the coal industry the following aid for 1980:    (a) an amount not exceeding FF 2 305 800 000 to cover losses on mining; </p><p>      (b) an amount not exceeding FF 350 000 000 to cover the financial losses sustained by the central administration of Charbonnages de France. </p><p>      </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Article 2</p><p> The Government of the French Republic shall notify the Commission by 31 October 1981 of details of the aids granted pursuant to this Decision and in particular of the amounts paid and the manner in which they are apportioned. </p><p> </p><p> Article 3</p><p> This Decision is addressed to the French Republic.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>   Done at Brussels, 10 July 1981. </p><p> For the Commission </p><p> Étienne DAVIGNON </p><p> Vice-President  </p><p> </p><p>  </p>\\n</TXT_TE>\\n</p>\\n</div>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n'}\n",
