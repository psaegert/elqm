                <p>COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION of 4 May 1976 on the rational use of energy in urban passenger transport
                    (76/495/EEC)</p>
                <p> THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, </p>
                <p> Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, </p>
                <p> Having regard to the draft from the Commission, </p>
                <p> Whereas, in its resolution of 17 September 1974 concerning a new energy policy strategy for the
                    Community (1), the Council accepted as an objective the &quot;reduction of the rate of growth of
                    internal consumption by measures for using energy rationally and economically without jeopardizing
                    social and economic growth objectives&quot;; </p>
                <p> Whereas, in its resolution of 17 December 1974 on a Community action programme on the rational
                    utilization of energy (2), the Council noted that, in its communication to the Council entitled
                    &quot;Rational utilization of energy&quot;, the Commission had drawn up a Community action programme
                    in this field; </p>
                <p> Whereas tangible results should be obtained as soon as possible in the rational use of energy ;
                    whereas measures in the field of urban passenger transport are likely to contribute to the
                    attainment of this objective; </p>
                <p> Whereas the measures recommended are likely to produce sufficiently large savings in energy to make
                    the required investment economically worthwhile; </p>
                <p> Whereas in its communication to the Council on the development of the common transport policy, the
                    Commission proposes the development of comprehensive policies that will bring about improvements not
                    only in the transport field but also in the energy situation, </p>
                <p> HEREBY RECOMMENDS TO THE MEMBER STATES: </p>
                <p> 1. that, with a view to ensuring rational use of both public transport and private vehicles, they
                    encourage the authorities responsible to promote frequent, convenient, regular, fast, reliable,
                    comfortable urban public passenger transport services. For instance, the construction of bus
                    shelters and the separation of private and public traffic, for example by introducing bus lanes and
                    special priorities for buses at traffic lights, should be encouraged; </p>
                <p> 2. that they encourage research into the improvement of existing equipment and experimentation with
                    public transport systems that will meet individual requirements more fully; </p>
                <p> 3. that, in order to reduce commuting distances by private car, they encourage the construction of
                    convenient parking areas near public transport termini and important stations and bus stops in urban
                    and suburban areas; </p>
                <p> 4. that they examine the advisability of changing fiscal and other regulations which encourage
                    commuting by private car and long-distance commuting py public transport; </p>
                <p> 5. that, where public transport is insufficient, they encourage the highest possible load factor in
                    private cars, particularly by removing the legislative and administrative barriers and regulations
                    which prevent car-pooling on a cost-sharing basis and by adopting the necessary laws, regulations or
                    administrative provisions to prevent insurance companies from introducing or maintaining contractual
                    barriers to such a system; (1)OJ No C 153, 9.7.1975, p. 1. (2)OJ No C 153, 9.7.1975, p. 5. </p>
                <p> 6. that they encourage all measures making the flow of traffic smoother, especially the flow of
                    public transport, for example by more extensive synchronization and programming of traffic lights.
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> The Council, in adopting this recommendation, is aware that when these measures are being studied
                    and implemented, their implications for other economic sectors including transport and taxation will
                    have to be taken into consideration. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p> Done at Brussels, 4 May 1976. </p>
                <p> For the Council </p>
                <p> The President </p>
                <p> G. THORN </p>
