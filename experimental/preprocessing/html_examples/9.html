                <p>Commission opinion</p>
                <p>of 1 October 2003</p>
                <p>concerning the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste resulting from modifications at the site of
                    the Philippsburg Nuclear Power Station KKP in the Federal Republic of Germany, in accordance with
                    Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty</p>
                <p>(2003/C 238/02)</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>(Only the German text is authentic)</p>
                <p>On 6 May 2003, the European Commission received from the Government of the Federal Republic of
                    Germany, in accordance with Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, general data relating to the plan for
                    the disposal of radioactive waste resulting from modifications at the site of the Philippsburg
                    Nuclear Power Station KKP.</p>
                <p>On the basis of these data, the Commission has considered that the plan concerned modifications to an
                    existing plan on which an opinion had already been given. The Commission has further taken into
                    consideration that the intermediate storage facility for irradiated fuel resulting from those
                    modifications is designed to operate up to 40 years and could remain in operation after
                    decommissioning and dismantling of the existing plant. Following consultation with the group of
                    experts, the Commission has drawn up the following opinion:</p>
                <p>(a) The planned modifications require no changes to the existing authorised limits for gaseous and
                    liquid discharges.</p>
                <p>(b) The planned modifications have no consequences in relation to the solid radioactive waste arising
                    from the operation of the existing plant.</p>
                <p>(c) The planned modifications have no consequences in relation to the unplanned discharges of
                    radioactive substances, which may follow an accident of the type and magnitude considered in the
                    general data of the existing plan.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the Commission is of the opinion that the implementation of the plan for the disposal
                    of radioactive waste in whatever form resulting from modifications at the site of the Philippsburg
                    Nuclear Power Station KKP, located in the Federal Republic of Germany, both in normal operation and
                    in the event of an accident of the type and magnitude considered in the general data, is not liable
                    to result in radioactive contamination, significant from the point of view of health, of the water,
                    soil or airspace of another Member State.</p>
