                <p>Commission Opinion</p>
                <p>of 20 February 2001</p>
                <p>concerning the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste from the dismantling of the Würgassen
                    nuclear power plant located in North-Rhine Westphalia in the Federal Republic of Germany</p>
                <p>(2001/C 72/02)</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>(Only the German text is authentic)</p>
                <p>On 13 July 2000 the European Commission received from the German Government, in accordance with
                    Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, general data relating to the plan for the disposal of radioactive
                    waste resulting from the dismantling of the Würgassen nuclear power plant.</p>
                <p>On the basis of these data and clarifications subsequently provided by the German Government, and
                    following consultation with the group of experts, the Commision has drawn up the following opinion:
                </p>
                <p>(a) The distance between the plant and the nearest point of another Member State, in this case The
                    Netherlands, is approximately 220 km,</p>
                <p>(b) Under normal operating conditions, the discharges of liquid and gaseous effluents will not cause
                    an exposure of the population in other Member States significant from the point of view of health,
                </p>
                <p>(c) Radioactive waste arising from the dismantling operations will be stored or disposed of in
                    licensed sites in Germany; non-radioactive solid waste or residual materials which are released from
                    regulatory control will be released for disposal as conventional waste or for reuse or recycling, in
                    all cases complying with the criteria laid down in the Basic Safety Standards (Directive
                    96/29/Euratom);</p>
                <p>(d) In the event of unplanned discharges of radioactive waste, which may follow an accident of the
                    type and magnitude considered in the general data, the doses likely to be received by the population
                    in other Member States would not be significant from the point of view of health.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the Commission is of the opinion that the implementation of the plan for the disposal
                    of radioactive waste, resulting from the dismantling of the Würgassen nuclear power plant, both in
                    normal operation and in the event of an accident of the type and magnitude considered in the general
                    data, is not liable to result in the radioactive contamination, significant from the point of view
                    of health, of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State.</p>
