                <p>COMMISSION DECISION of 3 June 1998 on the granting by Spain of aid to the coal industry in 1998
                    (notified under document number C(1998) 2045) (Only the Spanish text is authentic) (Text with EEA
                    relevance) (98/637/ECSC)</p>
                <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
                <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community,</p>
                <p>Having regard to Commission Decision No 3632/93/ECSC of 28 December 1993 establishing Community rules
                    for State aid to the coal industry (1), and in particular Article 2(1), and Articles 8 and 9
                    thereof,</p>
                <p>Whereas:</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I </p>
                <p>By Decision 94/1072/ECSC (2) the Commission gave an opinion as to the conformity of the 1994-1997
                    phase of the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plan for the coal
                    industry notified by Spain with the general and specific objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.</p>
                <p>By letter of 15 October 1997, Spain notified the Commission of the second phase (1998-2002) of the
                    modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plan for the coal industry.</p>
                <p>By letters of 17 December 1997, 20 February 1998 and 31 March 1998 Spain provided additional
                    information, in response to the requests contained in the Commission&#039;s letters of 14 November
                    and 22 December 1997.</p>
                <p>By letter of 31 March 1998, pursuant to Article 9(1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, Spain notified the
                    Commission of the financial measures it intended to take in respect of the coal industry in 1998.
                </p>
                <p>Under Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the Commission must:</p>
                <p>(a) give an opinion as to the conformity of the 1998-2002 phase of the modernisation,
                    rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plan for the Spanish coal industry with the
                    general and specific objectives of the Decision;</p>
                <p>(b) rule on the following financial measures relating to 1998:</p>
                <p>- aid of ESP 126 855 million to cover operating losses by coal undertakings,</p>
                <p>- aid of ESP 54 967 million to cover exceptional welfare aid paid to workers who lose their jobs as a
                    result of the measures to modernise, rationalise, restructure and reduce the activity of the coal
                    industry,</p>
                <p>- aid of ESP 11 995 million to cover the technical costs of closing down mining installations as a
                    result of the measures to modernise, rationalise, restructure and reduce the activity of the coal
                    industry.</p>
                <p>The financial measures proposed by Spain for the coal industry fall within the provisions of Article
                    1 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and must be approved by the Commission, in accordance with Article 9,
                    on the basis, in particular, of the general criteria and objectives laid down in Article 2 and the
                    specific criteria established by Articles 3 and 4 of that Decision. In accordance with Article 9(6)
                    of the Decision, the Commission must assess whether the measures are in conformity with the plans
                    notified.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>II </p>
                <p>The measures taken to implement the 1994-1997 phase of Spain&#039;s modernisation, rationalisation,
                    restructuring and activity-reduction plan deviated from the plans notified to and approved by the
                    Commission.</p>
                <p>In its evaluation of this phase of the plan the Commission found that the undertakings or production
                    units granted operating aid under Article 3 had made limited progress towards improving their
                    economic viability, relative to coal prices on international markets. Broadly speaking, those
                    undertakings had not made all the efforts announced on modernisation, rationalisation and
                    restructuring. When approving the aid, the Commission recognised the priority need to attenuate, as
                    far as possible, the social and regional impact of restructuring and to provide coal undertakings
                    with a medium-term outlook so that they could complete their restructuring. Nevertheless, those
                    undertakings will have to step up their restructuring efforts in the next phase, from 1998 to 2002.
                </p>
                <p>The undertakings or production units receiving aid for the reduction of activity under Article 4
                    adopted a series of measures over this period, conflicting with the obligation progressively to
                    reduce their production capacity by means of total or partial closures. Those measures resulted in a
                    significant increase in aid. In accordance with Article 9(6) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC the
                    Commission requested Spain to explain these deviations and to propose the necessary corrective
                    measures.</p>
                <p>Between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1997 Spain gradually brought the aid arrangements for the coal
                    industry, particularly the contracts between coal and electricity producers, into line with Decision
                    No 3632/93/ECSC, as provided for by Article 9(7).</p>
                <p>In response to the Commission&#039;s letter dated 14 November 1997 Spain made amendments to the
                    modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plans for 1998 to 2002
                    originally notified in its letter of 15 October 1997.</p>
                <p>The 1998-2002 phase of the definitive plan, notified by Spain by letter dated 31 March 1998, aims at
                    stepping up the modernisation, rationalisation and restructuring measures which coal undertakings
                    must implement to reduce their production costs in order to receive the operating aid provided for
                    in Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. Undertakings which are unable to reduce their production
                    costs or which, despite reducing them, would still be far from achieving economic viability will
                    have to step up their activity-reduction plan, as provided for by Article 4 of Decision No
                    3632/93/ECSC.</p>
                <p>For the undertakings receiving operating aid under Article 3, Spain has set a target of a minimum net
                    reduction in production of 1,9 million tonnes between l January 1998 and 23 July 2002, which by the
                    time that the plan is completed will take their maximum production level down to 12,7 million
                    tonnes, compared with 14,6 million tonnes in 1997.</p>
                <p>In order to confirm the trend towards a reduction in those undertakings&#039; production costs at
                    1992 prices, Spain must notify the Commission of 1997 production by 30 September 1998 at the latest.
                    If production cost trends over the period 1994 to 1997 show that certain undertakings or production
                    units fail to meet the conditions laid down in Article 3(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, Spain will
                    submit proposals to the Commission to subject them to a closure plan before 23 July 2002 or, where
                    appropriate, to a progressive and continuous activity-reduction plan, as provided for by Article 4
                    of the same Decision.</p>
                <p>Throughout the period from 1998 to 2002 Spain must monitor production cost trends at each of the coal
                    undertakings and, should they prove unable to generate a downward trend, will propose the necessary
                    corrective measures to the Commission.</p>
                <p>In view of the difficult geological conditions in Spain&#039;s coalfields, certain undertakings or
                    production units must be subject to a closure plan before 23 July 2002 or, where appropriate, a
                    progressive and continuous activity-reduction plan in order to qualify for the aid for the reduction
                    of activity (Article 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC).</p>
                <p>The company Endesa&#039;s underground production capacity of 0,315 million tonnes will be subject to
                    a closure plan to be completed before 23 July 2002.</p>
                <p>Given the exceptional social and regional conditions in the Asturias coalfields, Hunosa, Minas de
                    Figaredo SA and Mina de la Camocha SA will be subject to a progressive and continuous
                    activity-reduction plan.</p>
                <p>Production by Hunosa and Minas de Figaredo SA fell from a combined total of 3,12 million tonnes in
                    1993 to 2,66 million tonnes in 1996 and 2,42 million tonnes in 1997. Further reductions will have to
                    be made to take production down to a maximum of 1,8 million tonnes in 2001, representing a 42 %
                    reduction since 1993. The number of mineworkers will have to be reduced from 9 337 on 1 January 1998
                    to 6 500 by 31 December 2001 - 51 % down on l January 1994.</p>
                <p>The mines taken over by Hunosa from Minas de Lieres SA will have to close down definitively by 31
                    December 1999. Hunosa has given a commitment to make no further investment in preparing new reserves
                    from this mine, and Spain will undertake to grant no aid to cover production costs between l January
                    1998 and the closure date.</p>
                <p>Mina de la Camocha reduced production from 0,278 million tonnes in 1993 to 0,248 million tonnes in
                    1997. Further reductions will have to be made to take production down to a maximum of 0,183 million
                    tonnes in 2001, down by 34 % since 1993. The number of mineworkers fell from 1 091 on 1 January 1994
                    to 754 on 31 December 1997 and should be no more than 400 by 31 December 2001.</p>
                <p>The 1998-2002 plan for the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction of
                    the coal industry, notified by Spain, is in line with Article 2(1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC,
                    particularly with the objective of solving the regional and social problems created by total or
                    partial reductions in the activity of production units. In view of its social and regional aspects,
                    the plan notified to the Commission will be accompanied by conversion programmes for the mining
                    regions, entailing aid to restore industrial activity in the region wherever this is compatible with
                    the Treaties.</p>
                <p>The plan notified by Spain for 1998 to 2002 provides for an annual reduction in aid to current
                    production of 4 % for underground mines and 6 % for open-cast mines. This will help to achieve the
                    objective of degression of aid. The aid to cover the production costs of the undertakings or
                    production units, i.e. the aid under Article 3 and/or Article 4, is intended to cover all or part of
                    the difference between production costs and the selling price freely agreed between the contracting
                    parties in the light of the conditions prevailing on the world market.</p>
                <p>In accordance with Article 2(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, all the aid which Spain plans to grant
                    to the coal industry under that Decision for the period 1998 to 2002 will be entered in national,
                    regional or local public budgets. Part of the aid to Hunosa and Minas de Figaredo SA could be
                    channelled via SEPI (Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales), a public undertaking for
                    which the expenditure and revenue estimates are entered in the general State budgets.</p>
                <p>In view of the above, the plan submitted by Spain is in line with the general objectives laid down in
                    Article 2 and with the specific objectives established in Articles 3 and 4 of Decision No
                    3632/93/ECSC, provided that all the conditions laid down in that Decision are complied with, and
                    particularly the condition relating to non-discrimination between producers, purchasers and users of
                    coal in the Community.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>III </p>
                <p>The aid of ESP 126 855 million which Spain plans to grant the coal industry in 1998 is intended to
                    compensate in full or in part for operating losses suffered by coal undertakings.</p>
                <p>It is intended to cover the difference between production costs and the selling price freely agreed
                    between the contracting parties in the light of the conditions prevailing on the world market.</p>
                <p>The sum notified subdivides into operating aid of ESP 59 443 million under Article 3 of Decision No
                    3632/93/ECSC and aid of ESP 67 412 million to reduce activity under Article 4 of that Decision.</p>
                <p>The operating aid of ESP 59 443 million is intended to cover the operating losses suffered by 73
                    undertakings producing a total of 14,5 million tonnes in 1998. Spain will send notification of those
                    undertakings&#039; 1997 production costs by 30 September 1998 at the latest, to show trends between
                    1994 and 1997.</p>
                <p>Of the aid of ESP 67 412 million to reduce activity, ESP 61 054 million is intended to cover the
                    operating losses of Hunosa and Minas de Figaredo SA, ESP 5 361 million the operating losses of Mina
                    de la Camocha SA and ESP 997 million the operating losses of the underground workings of Endesa on
                    production totalling 3 million tonnes.</p>
                <p>Of the aid of ESP 61 054 million to Hunosa and Minas de Figaredo SA, ESP 44 429 million will be
                    granted via SEPI.</p>
                <p>The amount of aid notified by Spain for 1998 is 3 % lower than the aid authorised by the Commission
                    for 1997, after comparison with the selling prices in the light of the conditions prevailing on the
                    world market. Spain sent notification of the Council of Ministers&#039; decision on the
                    company-by-company allocation of this aid.</p>
                <p>The aid to cover the operating losses suffered by coal undertakings is entered in the general State
                    budgets for 1998.</p>
                <p>The inclusion of those measures in the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and
                    activity-reduction plan notified by Spain and the degression of the aid and quantities planned for
                    1998 are in line with the objectives of the first and second indents of Article 2(1) of the
                    Decision, particularly the objective of solving the social and regional problems created by
                    developments in the coal industry.</p>
                <p>In view of the above and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, this aid is compatible
                    with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common
                    market.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>IV </p>
                <p>The aid of ESP 54 967 million which Spain is proposing to grant will cover compensation for workers
                    who will lose their jobs or have to take early retirement under the modernisation, rationalisation,
                    restructuring and activity-reduction plan for the Spanish coal industry.</p>
                <p>Part of this aid, amounting to ESP 44 872 million, will be granted to Hunosa and Minas de Figaredo SA
                    to cover the costs for the workers who took early retirement before 1 January 1998 or will take
                    early retirement in 1998. This part of the aid will be granted to Hunosa and Minas de Figaredo via
                    SEPI.</p>
                <p>The remaining ESP 10 095 million of aid is intended to cover compensation for workers from the other
                    undertakings affected by modernisation, rationalisation and restructuring measures who will lose
                    their jobs in 1998.</p>
                <p>The aid to cover exceptional costs arising from restructuring is entered in the general State budgets
                    for 1998.</p>
                <p>The financial measures relate to action necessitated by the modernisation, rationalisation and
                    restructuring of the Spanish coal industry and cannot therefore be considered to be related to
                    current production (inherited liabilities).</p>
                <p>Pursuant to Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the aid mentioned explicitly in the Annex to the
                    Decision, namely the cost of paying social-welfare benefits resulting from the pensioning-off of
                    workers before they reach statutory retirement age and other exceptional expenditure on workers who
                    lose their jobs as a result of restructuring and rationalisation, may be considered compatible with
                    the common market, provided that the amount paid does not exceed such costs.</p>
                <p>In view of the above and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, this aid is compatible
                    with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common
                    market.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>V </p>
                <p>The aid of ESP 11 995 million which Spain proposes to grant is intended to cover part of the loss of
                    value of the fixed assets of coal undertakings which have to close down totally or partially and
                    other exceptional costs resulting from the progressive closures connected with the restructuring of
                    the coal industry.</p>
                <p>Part of this aid, totalling ESP 1 670 million, is to be granted to Hunosa and Minas de Figaredo SA
                    via SEPI. The remaining ESP 10 325 million of aid is intended for the other undertakings
                    restructuring or reducing their activity.</p>
                <p>The aid to cover exceptional costs arising from restructuring is entered in the general State budgets
                    for 1998.</p>
                <p>These financial measures relate to action made necessary by the modernisation, rationalisation and
                    restructuring of the Spanish coal industry and cannot therefore be considered to be related to
                    current production (inherited liabilities).</p>
                <p>Pursuant to Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the aid mentioned explicitly in the Annex to the
                    Decision, namely exceptional intrinsic depreciation, may, provided that it results from the
                    restructuring of the industry (without taking account of any revaluation which has occurred since l
                    January 1986 and which exceeds the rate of inflation) and other additional work and residual costs
                    arising from closures of installations, be considered compatible with the common market on condition
                    that the amount paid does not exceed such costs.</p>
                <p>Spain must ensure that the aid granted to undertaking to cover exceptional costs is in line with the
                    categories of costs defined in the Annex to Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.</p>
                <p>In view of the above and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, this aid is compatible
                    with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common
                    market.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>VI </p>
                <p>Spain must ensure that the aid to current production granted under this Decision gives rise to no
                    discrimination between producers, purchasers and users on the Community coal market.</p>
                <p>In view of the above and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, the aid and measures
                    planned for the coal industry are compatible with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and
                    with the proper functioning of the common market.</p>
                <p>This Decision applies without prejudice to the compatibility with the Treaties of any contracts
                    concluded between Spanish coal and electricity producers.</p>
                <p>In accordance with the second indent of Article 3(1) and with Article 9(2) and (3) of Decision No
                    3632/93/ECSC, the Commission must verify that the aid relates solely to the purposes set out in
                    Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Decision. To this end, it must be informed of the amounts involved and
                    the distribution of payments,</p>
