                  <p class="oj-normal">Directive (EU) 2018/2001 establishes requirements for certain fuels, namely
                     biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels, renewable liquid and gaseous fuels of non-biological origin
                     and recycled carbon fuels, in order to ensure that they can only be counted towards the targets set
                     in the Directive if they have been sustainably produced and save significant greenhouse gas
                     emissions in comparison to fossil fuels. First, Article 29 of the Directive lays down
                     sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for biofuels, bioliquids, and biomass
                     fuels, and Article 26 of the Directive and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/807 <a

                     hand. Second, Article 25(2) of the Directive lays down greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for
                     renewable liquid and gaseous fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels used in
                     transport. Third, Article 28(2) of the Directive requires economic operators to enter information
                     in a Union database on the transactions made and the sustainability characteristics of renewable
                     fuels (biofuels, biogas and renewable liquid and gaseous fuels of non-biological origin) and

                     important role in providing evidence of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas
                     emissions saving criteria for biofuels and bioliquids under Directive 2009/28/EC of the European

                     Directive (EU) 2018/2001, the role of voluntary schemes has been expanded. First, they can now
                     serve to certify compliance of all fuels produced from biomass, including gaseous and solid fuels,
                     with the sustainability criteria set in Directive (EU) 2018/2001, and provide accurate data on
                     their greenhouse gas emissions saving. Second, they can serve to certify compliance of renewable
                     liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels with their
                     greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria. Third, they can serve to prove compliance with the rules,
                     which Article 27(3) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 establishes to calculate renewable electricity in
                     transport. Fourth, they can serve to prove that economic operators enter accurate information into
                     the Union or national database on renewable fuels and recycled carbon fuels used in transport in
                     accordance with Article 28(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Fifth, they can be used to certify
                     biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels with low indirect land-use change-risk. The Commission may
                     decide that voluntary national or international schemes can serve all or some of these purposes.
