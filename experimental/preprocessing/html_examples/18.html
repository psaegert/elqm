                <p>COUNCIL RESOLUTION of 29 June 1988 concerning the activities to be undertaken by the Joint Research
                    Centre (JRC) (88/C 197/03)</p>
                <p>THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Commission&#039;s communication
                    entitled &#039;A new outlook for the Joint Research Centre&#039; submitted to the Council on 29
                    October 1987, Having regard to the modified proposals submitted to the Council by the Commission on
                    29 March 1988 containing specific research programmes to be implemented by the Joint Research Centre
                    for the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, </p>
                <p> 1. REAFFIRMS the Community character of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and considers it vital for
                    the JRC&#039;s future success that it should attain internationally acknowledged scientific
                    excellence and become more competitive, in order to play as full a part as possible in achieving the
                    Community&#039;s aim of strengthening the scientific and technological basis of European industry
                    and encouraging it to become more competitive, and urges the Commission to take all necessary
                    measures to achieve this end; </p>
                <p> 2. CONSIDERS that, with a view to contributing to the objective of the economic and social cohesion
                    of the Community, the JRC should also develop practical and significant initiatives to reinforce
                    collaboration with the research centres and laboratories of all Member States, thereby assuming the
                    role of catalyst of European scientific integration; </p>
                <p> 3. RECALLS its conclusions of 11 April 1988 in respect of the strengthening of the role of the Board
                    of Governors of the JRC and therefore welcomes the Commission decision on the revised terms of
                    reference of the Board; </p>
                <p> 4. URGES the Commission to introduce all necessary measures to improve the scientific excellence,
                    age profile and mobility of staff in and out of the JRC, with the aim of enhancing the
                    competitiveness of the JRC and reducing overall staff costs; </p>
                <p> 5. CONSIDERS further that the JRC should, in addition to its predominant task, for the period 1988
                    to 1991, of executing specific programmes including preparatory research, nevertheless utilize the
                    facilities and manpower at its disposal to strengthen and develop its work for other Commission
                    services and for third parties in those areas in which it is competent so to do; </p>
                <p> 6. BELIEVES it essential that work for third parties should be developed, under the control of the
                    Director-General of the JRC and in cooperation with the Board of Governors, on the basis of clearly
                    defined contractual arrangements with the Commission&#039;s services and third parties involved;
                </p>
                <p> 7. URGES that, during the period 1988 to 1991, an increasingly important share of the overall
                    financial turnover of the JRC should be devoted to such work, so as to enable the financial targets
                    set out at point B of the Annex to be reached; </p>
                <p> 8. CONSIDERS it appropriate that, on the basis of the aforementioned financial targets, the
                    necessary budgetary provision should be included by the budgetary authority in the general budget of
                    the European Communities on an annual basis by taking into account inter alia the anticipated
                    contractual work for third parties in the year in question and performance in this area in previous
                    years; </p>
                <p> 9. INVITES the Commission to include appropriate information on all the aforementioned categories of
                    activity in the annual implementation report which it is called upon to submit to the European
                    Parliament and the Council; </p>
                <p> 10. INTENDS, during the course of 1990, on the basis of an examination of progress achieved towards
                    a reorientation of the JRC and the work it undertakes, to consider possible adjustments or
                    additional measures required. </p>
