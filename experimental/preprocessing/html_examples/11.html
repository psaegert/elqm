                <p>COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION </p>
                <p>of 24 May 1983 </p>
                <p>to the Member States concerning the encouragement of investment in the use of solid fuel in public
                    buildings and in district heating systems </p>
                <p>(83/251/EEC) </p>
                <p>THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN </p>
                <p>COMMUNITIES, </p>
                <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article
                    235 thereof, </p>
                <p>Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission (1), </p>
                <p>Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), </p>
                <p>Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), </p>
                <p>Having regard to the communication from the Commission on the role for coal in Community energy
                    strategy, </p>
                <p>Whereas the considerable extent to which the Community is dependent on oil imports, with the
                    concomitant uncertainty regarding supplies and prices, imposes constraints on the Community economy;
                </p>
                <p>Whereas even a slight economic upturn in the industrialized countries, in conjunction with an
                    increase in oil demand in the rest of the world, could increase those constraints still further;
                </p>
                <p>Whereas the policy of oil substitution ought therefore to facilitate the necessary process of
                    structural adjustment; whereas this can only be accomplished by pursuing a policy of rational energy
                    use which includes increasing the contribution made by substitute sources of energy, with special
                    reference to solid fuel; </p>
                <p>Whereas it would be desirable to use solid fuel in both new and established installations; </p>
                <p>Whereas, even allowing for environmental considerations, public buildings and district heating
                    systems offer considerable scope for substituting solid fuel for oil; </p>
                <p>Whereas, despite the price advantage of solid fuel over fuel oil, the process of substitution has
                    made only a slow start; whereas the factors involved are in particular: </p>
                <p>- high investment and finance costs, </p>
                <p>- numerous other obstacles to investment, including environment-protection requirements, site
                    problems, lengthy approval procedures and uncertain economic prospects, particularly as regards the
                    relative price of solid fuel and oil, </p>
                <p>- lack of experience in the use of solid fuel, </p>
                <p>- shortcomings in the infrastructure for supplying solid fuel to consumers, </p>
                <p>- uncertainty about future developments in solid fuel technology; </p>
                <p>Whereas the use of solid fuel, including transport and waste-processing, should take place in a way
                    which takes the environment into account; </p>
                <p>Whereas the Member States should adopt in a concerted manner a coherent set of measures to encourage
                    investment in order to overcome these difficulties and obstacles, </p>
                <p>HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MEMBER STATES: </p>
                <p>1. Take all environmentally compatible measures, in public buildings (administrative buildings,
                    barracks, schools, etc.) and in suitable district heating systems, which they consider appropriate,
                    to encourage both the conversion or the reconversion to solid fuel of existing combustion
                    installations fired by fuel oil and to encourage the building of new solid-fuel-fired installations;
                </p>
                <p>2. Notify the Commission at the end of each year of the measures taken in the field covered by this
                    recommendation, so that the Commission can make an annual report to the Council in the appropriate
                    form. </p>
                <p>Done at Brussels, 24 May 1983. </p>
                <p>For the Council </p>
                <p>The President </p>
