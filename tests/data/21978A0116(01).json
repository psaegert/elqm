necessary to come to an interim agreement through the present exchange of letters until the entire Canada/Euratom Agreement of 1959 has been updated, to provide for the requirement of the new Canadian safeguards policy by amending the relevant provisions of the Canada/Euratom Agreement of 1959.</p>\n      <p class=\"normal\">Accordingly, I propose that the Canada/Euratom Agreement of 1959 be
