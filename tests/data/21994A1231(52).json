</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">THE CONTRACTING PARTIES TO THIS TREATY,</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Having regard to the Charter of Paris for a New Europe signed on 21 November 1990,</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Having regard to the European Energy Charter adopted in the Concluding Document of the Hague Conference on the European Energy Charter signed at The Hague on 17 December 1991,</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Recalling that all signatories to the Concluding Document of the Hague Conference undertook to pursue the objectives and principles of the European Energy Charter and implement and broaden their cooperation as soon as possible by negotiating in good faith an Energy Charter Treaty and Protocols, and desiring to place the commitments contained in that Charter on a secure and binding international legal basis;</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Desiring also to establish the structural framework required to implement the principles enunciated in the European Energy Charter;</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Wishing to implement the basic concept of the European Energy Charter initiative which is to catalyse economic growth by means of measures to liberalize investment and trade in energy;</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Affirming that Contracting Parties attach the utmost importance to the effective implementation of full national treatment and most favoured nation treatment, and that these commitments will be applied to the making of investments pursuant to a supplementary treaty,</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Having regard to the objective of progressive liberalization of international trade and to the principle of avoidance of discrimination in international trade as enunciated in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its Related Instruments and as otherwise provided for in this Treaty;</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Determined progressively to remove technical, administrative and other barriers to trade in energy materials and products and related equipment, technologies and services;</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Looking to the eventual membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of those Contracting Parties which are not currently parties thereto and concerned to provide interim trade arrangements which will assist those Contracting Parties and not impede their preparation for such membership;</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Mindful of the rights and obligations of certain Contracting Parties which are also parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its Related Instruments;</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Having regard to competition rules concerning mergers, monopolies, anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant position,</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Having regard also to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Nuclear Suppliers Guidelines and other international nuclear non-proliferation obligations or understandings,</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Recognizing the necessity for the most efficient exploration, production, conversion, storage, transport, distribution and use of energy;</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Recalling the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and its protocols, and other international environmental agreements with energy-related aspects; and</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">Recognizing the increasingly urgent need for measures to protect the environment, including the decommissioning of energy installations and waste disposal, and for internationally-agreed objectives and criteria for these purposes,</p>\n   <p class=\"normal\">HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:</p>\n   <p id=\"d1e134-24-1\" class=\"ti-section-1\">PART I</p>\n   <p

In exercising its functions, a panel shall consult with the disputing Contracting Parties and give them adequate opportunity to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution. Unless otherwise agreed by the disputing Contracting Parties, a panel shall base its decision on the arguments and submissions of the disputing Contracting Parties. Panels shall be guided by the interpretations given to the GATT and Related Instruments within the framework of the GATT, and shall not question the compatibility with Article 5 or 29 of practices applied by any Contracting Party which is a party to the GATT to other parties to the GATT to which it applies the GATT and which have not been taken by those other parties to dispute resolution under the GATT.</p>\n                                 <p class=\"normal\">Unless otherwise agreed by the disputing Contracting Parties, all procedures involving a panel, including the issuance of its final report, should be completed within 180 days of the date of establishment of the panel; however, a failure to complete all procedures within this period shall not affect the validity of a final report.</p>\n                              </td>\n                           </tr>\n                        </tbody>\n                     </table>\n                     <table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n                        <col width=\"4%\"/>\n                        <col width=\"96%\"/>\n                        <tbody>\n                           <tr>\n                              <td valign=\"top\">\n                                 <p class=\"normal\">(b)</p>\n                              </td>\n                              <td valign=\"top\">\n                                 <p class=\"normal\">A panel shall determine its jurisdiction; such determination shall be final and binding.
